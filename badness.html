      <h3>Explanations</h3>
      
   <div id="out_bound_highway" style="margin-top:20px">
     <label>There are some areas near the time-boundary that should clearly be
    included within the time-boundary</label>
     <br />
     <img src="img/out_bound_highway.png" class="img-responsive" />
     <br />
      <p>
     There are points in this image that seem like they
   should be included in the specified time-boundary, particularly,
   the highway in the top, near Hazel Dell South.
     </p>
     <p>
     The shape is calculated using 20 points distributed radially the
   center point. Because no point sits on that road but rather near
   the road, the furthest point you can get to on that road is not
   included in the shape calculation. Consequently, the resulting
   shape is just an estimate, and this issue should be taken into
   account when using the distance mapper.

    <div id="ace_locks" style="margin-top:20px">
      <label>I am in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on top of "Ace Lock

       <br />
     <img src="img/ace_lock.png" class="img-responsive" />
     <br />
      <p>
      This bizarre result seems to happen when small areas surrounded
   by water are used in the address. An example is Oahu, Hawaii. This
   is a known issue and we are working to address it.

    <div id="crazy_shape" style="margin-top:20px">
      <label>I am near a large body of water or am in a
   relatively isolated area, and the shape is completely wonky</label>
       <br />
     <img src="img/crazy_anchorage.png" class="img-responsive" />
     <br />
      <p>
      This crazy shape business seems to occur when the center point
   is a relatively isolated area. For instance, there are very few
   roads one can take out of Anchorage, AK, for 3 hours. Very few of
   the points used in the calculation were actually accessible by
   driving, so only a few of them could be used to draw the shape,
   resulting in a bizarre, unhelpful time-boundary. This is a known
   issue and we are working to address it.
