    <h3>The Perils of Commuting</h3>
    <p>
    This website was originally written when I was pondering moving to
    a new apartment. I had been reading articles like <a
    href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2011/06/perils-commuting">this</a>
    saying that long commutes are detrimental to health and
    happiness. I wanted to find an
    apartment within 20 minutes of work. However, I was having trouble
    finding a resource that let me know what neighborhoods fit this
    requirement. So, this website is the fruit of those frustrations!
    </p>
    <p>
    I hope you find this website as useful as I have! Please keep in
    mind while using it that it is in a beta mode, and not all
    locations have been tried. In fact, there are several known bugs
    that I am actively working on reparing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Have fun!
